# Stress Analysis and Lifestyle Survey of IU Students

## Overview

This project aims to understand **IU students' lifestyles, stress levels**, and their contributing factors. Through a comprehensive survey and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we uncover key stress factors and predict their impact using a regression model.

### Key Features:
- **Survey of 15 Questions**: Investigated various aspects of students' lifestyles and stress levels using Google Forms.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Revealed significant insights, including that **87% of respondents** identified **academics** as the primary source of stress.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used **word clouds** to visualize and analyze qualitative data on stressors and coping mechanisms.

## Objectives:
- Collect data on IU students' **lifestyles** and **stress factors**.
- Perform **EDA** to identify significant trends and insights.
- Apply **NLP techniques** to extract and visualize qualitative insights.
- Build a **predictive regression model** to forecast stress levels based on variables like **sleep patterns**, **socialization frequency**, **academic affiliations**, and more.

## Achievements:
- Executed a survey gathering insights on student stress factors.
- **87% of respondents** identified **academics** as the leading stress factor.
- Developed and presented a **predictive regression model** that delivers actionable insights into stress prediction.
